# Landing Page for a Recipe on Fettucine Alfredo

This was one of the first web pages I have ever created with HTML and CSS. This mini example is to show some understanding of HTML and CSS. 


## Roadmap

- Build a framework out of HTML 
- Placing the proper HTML code in the right places 
- Implementing CSS code to add style to the basic web page

## Tech Stack

**Client:** HTML, CSS, and some Google Images
